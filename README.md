# bem3_emf_qd2
This is the three-dimensional electromagnetic field analysis program for two-dimensional periodic arrangement objects irradiated by a plane wave. 
This is based on boundary element method, the own developed numerical solution is used.
This is full vector field three-dimensional analysis, the corner problem free. 
Intel Math Kernel Library is required. 
Gmsh is used for create a mesh data of object. 
The calculation program of quasi-periodic Green's function "d3_qpgf_d2" is used.
